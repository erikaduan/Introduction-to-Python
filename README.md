# Introductory Python materials

This repository contains a series of introductory Python coding materials, as completed at [Research Platform Services](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/infrastructure/research-platform-services#training), University of Melbourne. Their github account can be accessed [here](https://github.com/resbaz). Some coding exercises and their solutions are also derived from 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes (2016).  

The **aim** of this repository is to chronicle my Python learning progression and store my coding notes. All course content should be attributed to Research Platform Services and its excellent Python course instructors.
