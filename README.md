# Introductory Python materials

This repository of introductory Python materials has been gathered from a combination of:  

+ A series of excellent introductory Python coding workshops  that I completed at [Research Platform Services](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/infrastructure/research-platform-services#training), University of Melbourne in 2018 - 2019. Their original workshop materials, which forms the basis of these notes, can be accessed [here](https://github.com/resbaz).  
+ An introductory Python workshop given by Dr Pantelis Enas in 2020, as part of CSIRO Data61's [data science workshops](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/csiro-data61-26859581097) for the Australian Public Service.  
+ Python Crash Course - a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming by Eric Matthes (8th Edition).  

The **aim** of this repository is to chronicle and share my own Python learning progression. Coding notes should be attributed to the three sources listed above, in particular to Research Platform Services and its excellent Python workshop instructors.
